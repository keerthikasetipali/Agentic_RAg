It shall reduce manual process inefficiencies in procurement and provide a paperless and cashless e-marketplace with a streamlined, consistent process for all users.

GeM uses modern technology and enablers and brings together all government buyers on a unified online platform for the procurement of commonly used goods and services. GeM reduces manual process inefficiencies in procurement and provides a paperless and cashless e-marketplace with a streamlined, consistent process for all users. The nature of the platform is characterized by three core elements Openness: GeM shall be an open marketplace wherein it promotes access to information and transparency. Relevant information on sellers, products, and services shall be easy to find and readily available for both buyers and sellers. GeM shall provide data-based insights to help users in decision-making and ascertaining price reasonability. Fairness: One of GeM’s\n"
