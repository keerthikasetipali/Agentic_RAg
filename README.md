**Overview**:

Agentic RAG is a project designed to implement and enhance a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. This project aims to provide an efficient and scalable solution for retrieving relevant information and generating responses based on that information. It integrates state-of-the-art techniques for natural language processing and retrieval-augmented generation.

**Features**:


Retriever-Augmented Generation: Combines retrieval and generation to improve response accuracy.
Flexible Integration: Easily integrate with various datasets and document sources.
Scalable: Designed to handle large-scale data and generate high-quality responses.

**Installation**:
 
 To get started with the Agentic RAG project, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You will also need to install the necessary dependencies.

**Install_Dependencies**:
 You can install the required Python packages using pip. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
